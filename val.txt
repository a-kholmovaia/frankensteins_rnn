“it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and i saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. by degrees, i remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that i was obliged to shut my eyes. darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had i felt this when, by opening my eyes, as i now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. i walked and, i believe, descended, but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations. before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but i now found that i could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid. the light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as i walked, i sought a place where i could receive shade. this was the forest near ingolstadt; and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst. this roused me from my nearly dormant state, and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. i slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
“it was dark when i awoke; i felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. before i had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, i had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. i was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; i knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, i sat down and wept.
“soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. [the moon] i gazed with a kind of wonder. it moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and i again went out in search of berries. i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak, with which i covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. no distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. i felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon, and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.
“several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other. i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. i began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.
“the moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while i still remained in the forest. my sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; i distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.
“one day, when i was oppressed by cold, i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it. in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. how strange, i thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! i examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. i quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. i reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. when night came on and brought sleep with it, i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, i lay on the ground and sank into sleep.
“it was morning when i awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. i uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. when night came again i found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees. i tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
“food, however, became scarce, and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. when i found this, i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied. in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, i struck across the wood towards the setting sun. i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. a great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.
“it was about seven in the morning, and i longed to obtain food and shelter; at length i perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. this was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great curiosity. finding the door open, i entered. an old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. he turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. his appearance, different from any i had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, i did not like. then, overcome by fatigue, i lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
“it was noon when i awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, i determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet i found, i proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset i arrived at a village. how miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. the vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. one of the best of these i entered, but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. the whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village. this hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, i dared not enter it. my place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it. no wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
“here, then, i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found. it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. one part was open, and by that i had crept in; but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light i enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.
“having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, i retired, for i saw the figure of a man at a distance, and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. i had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which i purloined, and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. the floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.
“being thus provided, i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step, and looking through a small chink, i beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. the girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. i lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. as she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. she followed, and they disappeared. presently i saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.
“on examining my dwelling, i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. in one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as i had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and i withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.
“soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. the girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. she afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. after he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.
“the old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. the meal was quickly dispatched. the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. one was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. the old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.
“night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours. in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. so soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; i since found that he read aloud, but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters.
“the family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as i conjectured, to rest.” 
“i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep. i thought of the occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not. i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.
“the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.
“this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. the young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. the old man, whom i soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
“they were not entirely happy. the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. i saw no cause for their unhappiness, but i was deeply affected by it. if such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? they possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. what did their tears imply? did they really express pain? i was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.
“a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. they often, i believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.
“this trait of kindness moved me sensibly. i had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers, i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood.
“i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours. i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night i often took his tools, the use of which i quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
“i remember, the first time that i did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. she uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. i observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.
“by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment. i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. this was indeed a godlike science, and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it. but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose. their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference. by great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; i learned and applied the words, fire, milk, bread, and wood. i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. the youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was father. the girl was called sister or agatha, and the youth felix, brother, or son. i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy.
“i spent the winter in this manner. the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, i felt depressed; when they rejoiced, i sympathised in their joys. i saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. the old man, i could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes i found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. he would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. it was not thus with felix. he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. but if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.
“i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. in the midst of poverty and want, felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. in the day, i believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. at other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and agatha.
“this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. i conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and i ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? i improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for i easily perceived that, although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.
“i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool! at first i started back, unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror. and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am, i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. alas! i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
“as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth. from this time felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. their food, as i afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.
“the old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. this frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
“my mode of life in my hovel was uniform. during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, i slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. when they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. when i returned, as often as it was necessary, i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix. i afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice i heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but i did not then understand the signification of these terms.
“my thoughts now became more active, and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad. i thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. when i slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle agatha, and the excellent felix flitted before me. i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. i imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, i should first win their favour and afterwards their love.
“these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease. it was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.
“the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. the birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.” 
“i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep. i thought of the occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not. i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.

“these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease. it was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.
“the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. the birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”
“i now hasten to the more moving part of my story. i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what i had been, have made me what i am.
“spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.
“it was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
“it was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of felix. her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. on hearing this word, felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.
“felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which i could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger. she appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as i could distinguish, his sweet arabian. she did not appear to understand him, but smiled. he assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
“i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. they made many signs which i did not comprehend, but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian. agatha, the ever-gentle agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which i did not comprehend. presently i found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end. the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which i had before understood, but i profited by the others.
“as night came on, agatha and the arabian retired early. when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘good night sweet safie.’ he sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. i ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.
“the next morning felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. she sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
“when she had finished, she gave the guitar to agatha, who at first declined it. she played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
“the days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. safie was always gay and happy; she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.
“in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for i never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered.
“my days were spent in close attention, that i might more speedily master the language; and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.
“while i improved in speech, i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.
“the book from which felix instructed safie was volney’s ruins of empires. i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. he had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. i heard of the slothful asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, christianity, and kings. i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
“these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing.
“every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. i heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
“the words induced me to turn towards myself. i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. a man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! and what was i? of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant, but i knew that i possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. i was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; i was not even of the same nature as man. i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me. was i, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
“i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; i tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. oh, that i had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
“of what a strange nature is knowledge! it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which i feared yet did not understand. i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but i was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which i obtained by stealth, when i was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows. the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me. the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me. miserable, unhappy wretch!
“other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. i heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.
“but where were my friends and relations? no father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing. from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion. i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. what was i? the question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
“i will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so i loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”
 it was long before he was restored, and i often thought that life was entirely extinct. at length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
his sentence was pronounced, and i could only grieve and be patient. i sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and i thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, “alas! the strength i relied on is gone; i feel that i shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. think not, walton, that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed; but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do i find it blamable. in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. this was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. urged by this view, i refused, and i did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end. miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. the task of his destruction was mine, but i have failed. when actuated by selfish and vicious motives, i asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and i renew this request now, when i am only induced by reason and virtue.
“yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to england, you will have little chance of meeting with him. but the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, i leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. i dare not ask you to do what i think right, for i may still be misled by passion.
“that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when i momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years. the forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and i hasten to their arms. farewell, walton! seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. yet why do i say this? i have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”
his voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence. about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.
margaret, what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble. my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. but i journey towards england, and i may there find consolation.
i am interrupted. what do these sounds portend? it is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie. i must arise and examine. good night, my sister.
great god! what a scene has just taken place! i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.
i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. as he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. when he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. i called on him to stay.
he paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.
“that is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! oh, frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me? i, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. alas! he is cold, he cannot answer me.”
his voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. i approached this tremendous being; i dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. i attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
“your repentance,” i said, “is now superfluous. if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, frankenstein would yet have lived.”
“and do you dream?” said the dæmon. “do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse? he,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. oh! not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. a frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears? my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.
“after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. i pitied frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; i abhorred myself. but when i discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but i was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey. yet when she died! nay, then i was not miserable. i had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. evil thenceforth became my good. urged thus far, i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen. the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. and now it is ended; there is my last victim!”
i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “wretch!” i said. “it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. you throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. it is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.”
“oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being. “yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. no sympathy may i ever find. when i first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that i wished to be participated. but now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should i seek for sympathy? i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when i die, i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding. i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. no guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. but it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation; i am alone.
“you, who call frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions. for while i destroyed his hopes, i did not satisfy my own desires. they were for ever ardent and craving; still i desired love and fellowship, and i was still spurned. was there no injustice in this? am i to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? why do you not hate felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! i, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
“but it is true that i am a wretch. i have murdered the lovely and the helpless; i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. i have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. there he lies, white and cold in death. you hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself. i look on the hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
“fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief. my work is nearly complete. neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been. i shall die. i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. he is dead who called me into being; and when i shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must i find my happiness. some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, i should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can i find rest but in death?
“farewell! i leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. farewell, frankenstein! if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. but it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that i might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel. blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.
“but soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “i shall die, and what i now feel be no longer felt. soon these burning miseries will be extinct. i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. the light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. my spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. farewell.”
he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. he was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.
